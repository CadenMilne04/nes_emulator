# Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator 🕹️
An ambitious attempt to learn the Rust programming language.
(yes, this is the first time I have touched this language)


## Tools 🛠️
- 🗣️ Language: Rust
- 📺 Graphics and I/O: SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer)
- 👨‍💻 Editor: NeoVim (Check out my NeoVim config repo!)

## What I learned:
- Rust is a lot more convenient to use than just plain C, I did enjoy some of the cool syntax features and I was so happy with the `todo!()` function.
- Emulation is HARD. The NES is supposed to be somewhat of a beginner system, but I did struggle with understanding some of the different hardware components and the
clever memory manipulation tricks used to make those games run on the hardware that was out at the time.
- Expanded my knowledge on assembly, machine code, and systems programming.
- The blog introduced me to new ways to approach projects at this scale, and I did notice some of the author's programming style was admirable.

## Final Thoughts:
Overall, the Rust programming experience was an enjoyable one, I think I want to move on to something else for the time being. It was cool to work on such a 
large project.

In my opinion it is the best written tutorial I have seen so far online and I can't thank the author enough for the amount of work that I am sure it took to
create such a good tutorial.
